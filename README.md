A program that preforms a Caeser Chipher on a string of text inputted.

Simply, a Caeser Chipher is a very basic form of cryptography. It shifts the letters of the alphabet onward by the set amount.

If you wanted to encrypt 'abc' and shift it by 1, it would become 'bcd'. More complex, if you were to cipher 'Hello World! by 5, you would get 'Mjqqt Btwqi!'
